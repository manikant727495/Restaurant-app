Welcome to iNotebook, a user-friendly note-taking website that enables users to register and login securely. After logging in, users can create, update, and delete their notes with ease.

The website also offers a user-friendly profile section where users can view and update their profile information. Once all the tasks are completed, users can securely logout.

With an intuitive user interface and secure login system, iNotebook makes note-taking a seamless experience. This project showcases my proficiency in web development technologies such as React JS, Node.js, and MongoDB, as well as user authentication and profile management.
